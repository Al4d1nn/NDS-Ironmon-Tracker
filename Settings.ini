; Set the location where your pre-generated ROMs are stored here. This allows you to make use of the controller shortcut to
; switch to the next seed in the series specified in the NEXT_SEED setting below. As a reminder, your pre-generated seeds
; must be in a numerical order without leading zeroes. For example: you can name your series of seeds as 'kaizo21.gba',
; 'kaizo22.gba', 'kaizo23.gba', etc. and the controller shortcut will swap successfully.
; Example: ROMS_FOLDER=C:\Users\Besteon\roms
ROMS_FOLDER=D:\PokeRandoZX-v4_4_0\HGseeds

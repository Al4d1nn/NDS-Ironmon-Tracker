Is this the part where it gets called a skill issue?
There's always next time...
Some things were just not meant to be.
Oh well.
Could have been worse, I guess. Or not.
Against all odds... you did not triumph.
How unfortunate.
Maybe you just didn't believe hard enough.
That's just the way it goes sometimes.
You should definitely pick the left ball next attempt.
Having fun yet?
The house always wins.
One day you'll finally push the boulder up that hill.
Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.
Looks like your luck finally ran out.
